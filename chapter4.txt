Why are all of these hallways so empty?

Have all of you arrived at your hiding places?

I haven't found mine. 
Even though the likeness to darkness grew on me, the thought 
of finding that last beam of light lingered on.

I wanted to wrap my fingers around your tiny hand.
Just tell me why did you do it. 
I don't want to blame you, but you covered
those lovely sources of photons.

I apologize if I raised my voice. 
Everything I knew was broken, was torn to pieces.
meaningless and tiny pieces. 

What's nothing to nothing?
That thought might as well not exist. 


I never thought I'd say so many things to myself before reaching the end 
of this hallway.

Getting used to this conditioned air. 

So,let me sleep tonight.
Summer's outside.

Bye.
