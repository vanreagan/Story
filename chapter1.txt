The long shadow was casted over her face.
The sunset behind me was the gun. 
My stupid shape the barrel and that dreaded lack of light, the bullet.


The trembling hand held the gun up to her face.
Covering her void with blood.
Eat the bullet, you piece of art. 
Tonight I don't care about sleep.

The summer's never ending if I bury autumn with you.
