Her steps sounded like thunder in my ears.
I could feel the fear in every cell of my tissue.
I was pure tissue. 
No soul. 
Yet, these feels made me think I was alive.

The night rolled over again.
I was seeking her back.
A blurry picture of her face.
A tiny speck of her scent. 

Wasn't this summer supposed to end already?
The tremors are still lingering on my pillow.

I didn't cry to sleep last time, but I'm sure today I will.

Picture me laying in the bed wearing only my underwear. 

She didn't care about this skin, she didn't think I was nothing.

But I'm sure she didn't love me. 

What's there when there isn't any love?

Those devoid of light are dark, yet the devoid of love is more love.

A paradox that seeks equilibrium. At least it does in my head.

She isn't around but the echoes of her laughs are louder than the cracks on my voice. 

She isn't in the same world, still her shadow drifts accross. 

I swear I can see it with every lightning that finds its resting ground.
